# COVIDâ€‘19 in India Analysis Dashboard

ðŸŽ¯ **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** delivering comprehensive insights into COVIDâ€‘19 trends, testing, vaccination, and regional patterns across India.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

This Tableau Public workbook was built following the YouTube tutorial **"Create Covidâ€‘19 in India Dashboard with Tableau inâ€¯33â€¯minutes" by Stanley George Joseph**, and further customized to present detailed state-wise and national COVIDâ€‘19 analytics.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Key Features:
- Timeâ€‘series charts tracking confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time.
- Geographic choropleth map visualizing state-wise infection and mortality hotspots.
- Demographic breakdowns: gender and age distributions where data is available.
- Vaccination analysis: first vs second dose, vaccine type comparisons (e.g. Covishield vs Covaxin).
- Testing dashboards: number of tests, positivity rates across Indian states.
- Interactive filters for state selection, date range slider, and demographic toggles.

## ðŸ“‹ Dashboard Structure & Visuals

| Section               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Map Overview**      | A dynamic map of India illustrating COVIDâ€‘19 case density and mortality per state, including tooltips for deeper insights. |
| **Trend Analytics**   | Interactive line charts showing cumulative numbers and daily new cases for confirmed, recovered, and deaths on both national and state level. |
| **Demographic Insights** | Visualizations of case distribution by gender and age group; cleaned and filtered to account for missing data. |
| **Vaccination Dashboard** | Bar charts comparing first/second dose volumes trimmed by state and vaccine type. |
| **Testing Dashboard**     | State-by-state testing performance: total tests administered and positivity rate over time. |

## ðŸ”§ Data Processing & Workflow

- Multiple datasets ingested: case counts, vaccinations, tests, demographic stats.
- Tableau data blending by keys like *state* and *date*, using CSVs and official data sources.
- Calculated fields created for metrics like positivity rate, recovery ratio, dose comparisons.
- Custom filters and parameters implemented for drill-down interactivity.
- Map built using India shapefiles and customized color palettes for clarity.

## ðŸŽ¥ Inspiration & Implementation

Following the tutorial by **Stanley George Joseph**, core methodologies were adopted including:

1. **Data import & blending** across multiple sheets.
2. **Time-series visualization** using line charts.
3. **State-level mapping** for spatial analysis.
4. **Dashboard layout** combining separate sheets into one interactive view.
5. **User filters & tooltips** for intuitive navigation.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

The final workbook incorporates additional enhancements like demographic filters and vaccine-type visuals to enrich storytelling and polish the presentation.
